1. Heat oil

2. In a cast iron skillet or Dutch oven, heat olive oil on medium flame

3. Add aromatics

4. After about 30 seconds, add garlic paste (or minced garlic), ginger paste, 1 tsp of turmeric, and cumin powder - be careful to add before the oil gets too hot, otherwise it will splatter!

5. Saute for 30 seconds to infuse the oil - when done, it should look dark throughout

6. Add onions

7. Now, add the chopped onion and saute for about 1 minute until the onion gets brown

8. Add veggies

9. Then, add carrots, potatoes, water and turmeric and mix well to infuse with spices

10. Cover, cook

11. Cover and cook for 10 minutes on medium flame. Then, open and check if the carrots and potatoes are cooked by piercing them with a fork. If not, cook for a few more minutes until they're soft.

12. Add cabbage

13. Then, stir in the cabbage, add salt and pepper (to taste) and cook covered again until the cabbage is properly cooked, but not too long that it becomes mushy (I've found this takes roughly 5 minutes)

14. Serve hot with rice or flatbread!
