1. Blend tomato, red bell pepper, habanero pepper, fresno chili, garlic, ginger, and water until smooth

2. Heat olive oil in a saucepan with tight lid over medium heat. Add onion and salt and sauté until onion starts to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. 

3. Clear space in the middle of the pan, add tomato paste, and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes. Season with paprika, curry powder, cumin, thyme, pepper, and turmeric; continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes until everything is well combined.

4. Turn off the heat, and stir in the rice, making sure every grain of rice is coated with the mixture. 

5. Add bay leaf and chicken bouillon paste and stir in the sauce.

6. Bring to a vigorous simmer. Cover with a tight fitting lid, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 20 minutes.
